This is a remake of Google's homepage I made to practice HTML and CSS. 

The links all go to their respective pages, the search bar will search the query on Google's homepage, and the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button will go to the first page result from Google.

I have not implemented the small black box matrix, so for now it is just a picture.
